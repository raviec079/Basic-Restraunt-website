        <pre><h4 style="font-size: 20px;">The waiters were kind and courteous. Food was great, 
the flavours were very subtle and soothing.
We ordered Tibetan thukpa, Lotus stem in Hunan sauce and Veg Red Thai curry with steamed rice. 
The cranberry orange iced tea was refreshing.
Would definitely visit again.

        <pre><h4 style="font-size: 20px;">I was there the other day it was late around 8 pm . 
I saw the guy at the reception throwing away food  cause they were closing .
which could have been donated to the less privileged people that cannot afford food .
When asked he said it's cold so what if it's cold people out on streets who sleep hungry would not care about cold or warm ..
really donot appreciate  such practice ..
